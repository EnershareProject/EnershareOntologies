The ENERSHARE ontology was created within the framework of the European project ENERSHARE with the aim of establishing an energy data space. 
Eleven use cases across seven pilots were analyzed. A reuse methodology was prioritized to meet the needs of these use cases.

New modules were developed to complete the conceptualization of aspects not covered by existing ontologies. 
Eighteen modules were created, and the needs of the eleven use cases are represented in diagrams to assist stakeholders in the semanticization process of their use cases.

It is important to note that the conceptualization is scenario-oriented, which implies that the ENERSHARE ontology does not cover the entire scope of systems in the energy domain 
but is limited to the needs expressed in the use cases and by the stakeholders.
