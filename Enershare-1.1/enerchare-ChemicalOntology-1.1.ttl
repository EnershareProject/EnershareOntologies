                indicates that about 40% of the average 17 TgN/yr (teragrams, or million metric tons, of nitrogen per year) of emissions originated from human activity, 
                and shows that emissions growth chiefly came from expanding agriculture. Being the third most important greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide also substantially contributes 
                to global warming.Nitrous oxide is used as a propellant, and has a variety of applications from rocketry to making whipped cream. It is used as a recreational drug 
                for its potential to induce a brief "high". Most recreational users are unaware of its neurotoxic effects when abused. When used chronically, nitrous oxide has 
                the potential to cause neurological damage through inactivation of vitamin B12. (source https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide)""";

                """In atmospheric chemistry, NOx is shorthand for nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), the nitrogen oxides that are most relevant for 
                air pollution. These gases contribute to the formation of smog and acid rain, as well as affecting tropospheric ozone.
                NOx gases are usually produced from the reaction between nitrogen and oxygen during combustion of fuels, such as hydrocarbons, in air; especially at 
                high temperatures, such as in car engines. In areas of high motor vehicle traffic, such as in large cities, the nitrogen oxides emitted 
                can be a significant source of air pollution. NOx gases are also produced naturally by lightning.
                NOx does not include nitrous oxide (N2O), a fairly inert oxide of nitrogen that contributes less severely to air pollution, notwithstanding its 
                involvement in ozone depletion and high global warming potential.  (source https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOx) """@en ;
